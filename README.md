# Car-trumps-project

A top trumps inspired app built with Javascript, HTML and CSS.
The app allows the user to navigate through a garage of pre-made vehicles and review the stats of individual vehicles by clicking through to see the individual car-card. Users also have the ability to create their own vehicle using drop-down boxes to select the stats they want their car to have. Once they have completed creating and naming the car they can submit their creation and it will be added to the database. From there they will be able to navigate back to the garage and see their vehicle added to the fleet. The backend of this app is hosted through heroku and utilises Strapi as the content management system.
